# Project-Quiz
This is my first Project on Java script ,HTML & CSS. The project is a quiz based on a famous tele show "Who wants to be a millionaire.

## How does the Quiz works

The game is quite simple quiz game. The participant have to answer the set of questions and for each correct answer they are awarded money (imagnary) the amount of the money keeps increasing with each correct response and the game ends under two conditions. First, When the participant answer all the questions correctly or if the participant answer is not correct.
